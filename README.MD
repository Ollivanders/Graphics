Welcome:
To view the classroom, after unzipping the files, open the ClassRoomDisplay.html file inside the Room directory, firefox or another browser. Texturing is used so the browser must have access to local files which is why firefox is recommended. The canvas is rendered fairly large to produce a better quality experience, therefore simply zoom out until you can see the canvas borders if your default browser settings put you to close in.

The classroom has been prepared for the Software Methodologies exam with papers laid out. Controlling the room is as follows:

Navigation:
The virtual camera or your position and view in the room is intuitive to control. You start looking at the room through the front wall:

Movement:
W --> Forward
S --> Back
A --> Left
D --> Right
E --> Move up
Q --> Move down

Panning, this is changing your perspective, where you are looking at:
Up Arrow Key --> yaw forwards
Down Arrow Key --> yaw Backwards
Left Arrow Key --> look Left
Right Arrow Key --> Right Left

Important to note. The walls and the things they are made of vanish as you pass through them so that you can still maintain a cross sectional view of the room as you leave it.

The controlling of lighting within the room is done using the digit keys:
Numbers 1-4: Control the ceiling lights starting with the far right from the starting position. The back two lights are off my default when looking at the whiteboard but can be turned on and off.
Number 5: Controls the screen of the laptop which is a light source and illuminates the room at night well

Other dynamic objects, they are turned on and off respectively by simply pressing the button:
T --> controls the blinds and light coming through them. Shutting the blinds converts the scene to night time.
Y --> Moves all the chairs in the scene back to allow exam participants to sit down and slightly slow pushes them back in
R --> Controls the opening and closing of the door to allow people to enter and leave
